## Running the tests

There is a Perl 5 script with the extension `.t`, which will be used to test
your solution. You can run through the tests by using the command:

```bash
`prove .`
```

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit Bob.pm` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor
