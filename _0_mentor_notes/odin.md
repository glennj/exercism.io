# Odin

Some gatherings of links and such, in preparation of writing track docs

  > An open source systems programming language designed for the modern computer and programmer
  >
  > Odin is fast, concise, readable, and pragmatic. It is designed with the intent of replacing C with the following goals:
  >
  > - simplicity
  > - high performance
  > - built for modern systems
  > - joy of programming

- origin of Odin, from https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2019/05/13/a-reply-to-the-road-to-zig/

  > I wanted a language that solved many of the issues I had with programming.
  > I wanted the specification of the language to be 100% knowable by a mere mortal.
  > [...]
  > 
  > At the turn of 2016, I gave myself a New Year’s Resolution to start any new personal programming project in pure C to see what I really needed from a language.
  > It turned out that I needed very little to be very productive.
  > The friction from having to remember many of the features in C++ and other languages reduced my productivity a lot more than I realised.
  > From using pure C for a few months, I noticed that there were features that I wanted to add to C to increase my productivity and reducing errors.
  > These features included defer and tagged-unions.
  > I started creating a metaprogramming tool to augment my C code so I could add these new features.
  > I quickly began to realise that what I wanted was a new language as this endeavour was a dead-end.
  > 
  > The project started one evening in late July 2016 when I was annoyed with programming in C++ (not a new project).
  > The language began as a Pascal clone (with begin and end and more) but changed quite quickly to become something else.
  > 
  > Odin borrows heavily from (in order of philosophy and impact): Pascal, C, Go, Oberon.
  > Niklaus Wirth and Rob Pike have been the programming language design idols throughout this project.
  > Simplicity was always a deriving force in the design, but as I found very early on, simplicity is complicated.
  > 
  > The design underwent a lot of revisions and experiments in the very early stages as I did not know what was optimal for increasing my productivity.
  > I knew the basic concepts of what I wanted but that was it.
  > Concepts such as the package system took nearly a year to flesh-out and design as it took a while to discover what were the actual problems with certain approaches.
  > 
  > At the end of the day, I am a pragmatic man and I do not see the need for type-theory purity if it increases friction in the language.
