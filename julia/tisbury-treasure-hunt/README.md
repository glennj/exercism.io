# Tisbury Treasure Hunt

Welcome to Tisbury Treasure Hunt on Exercism's Julia Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

A `Tuple` is quite similar to a `Vector` (1-D `array`) in many ways.
However, there are a few important differences.

- Tuples are written in parentheses `( )` instead of brackets `[ ]`, though the parentheses can be omitted in cases where the meaning is unambiguous.
- Tuples are not required to be homogeneous: the type of each element is stored independently.
- Tuples are immutable.

Immutability allows more compiler optimizations and makes tuples more performant than vectors, so they should be preferred in cases where mutability is not necessary.

```julia-repl
julia> t = (3, 5.2, "xyz")
(3, 5.2, "xyz")

# Non-homogeneous:
julia> dump(t)
Tuple{Int64, Float64, String}
  1: Int64 3
  2: Float64 5.2
  3: String "xyz"

julia> t[2]
5.2

# Immutable:
julia> t[2] = 7.3
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching setindex!(::Tuple{Int64, Float64, String})
```

There is also a `Tuple()` constructor, which will turn any iterable collection into a tuple.
Usefully, this treats a string as an iterable collection of characters.

```julia-repl
julia> Tuple("Julia")
('J', 'u', 'l', 'i', 'a')
```

For any tuple, it is possible to access elements by index or loop over them.

Any purely numerical tuple can also be used in mathematical functions such as `sum()`, exactly like arrays.

## Unpacking

A tuple can be unpacked into individual elements by using multiple assignment.
For elements that are not required, use underscore `_` as the dummy variable.

```julia-repl
julia> tup = (1, "Julia", true)
(1, "Julia", true)

julia> num, name, _ = tup
(1, "Julia", true)

julia> uppercase(name), 2num
("JULIA", 2)
```

Python programmers will be very familiar with this multiple-assignment syntax.

## Named tuples

A `Tuple` contains only values.
A `NamedTuple` pairs each value with a name.

Individual fields can then be accessed with "dot" notation:

```jullia-repl
julia> nt = (a = 1, b = 7.3)
(a = 1, b = 7.3)

julia> dump(nt)
@NamedTuple{a::Int64, b::Float64}
  a: Int64 1
  b: Float64 7.3

julia> nt.b
7.3
```

The name is stored internally as a `Symbol` (an immutable type, prefixed with a colon `:`), so there is an alternative syntax available:

```julia-repl
julia> nt[:b]
7.3
```

It is easy to get either the names (also called "keys") or values separately:

```julia-repl
julia> nt
(a = 1, b = 7.3)

julia> keys(nt)
(:a, :b)

julia> values(nt)
(1, 7.3)
```

Note that iteration over a named tuple only produces the _values_, and the _names_ are ignored.

Tuples (named or not) are a very common way to transfer structured data to and from functions.
Immutability is good in this use case, providing data safety and allowing more aggressive compiler optimizations.

## Instructions

Azara and Rui are teammates competing in a pirate-themed treasure hunt.
One has a list of treasures with map coordinates, the other a list of location names with map coordinates.
They've also been given blank maps with a starting place marked YOU ARE HERE.

But things are a bit disorganized: Azara's coordinates appear to be formatted and sorted differently from Rui's, and they have to keep looking from one list to the other to figure out which treasures go with which locations.
Being budding Julia programmers, they have come to you for help in writing a small program (a set of functions, really) to better organize their hunt information.

## 1. Extract coordinates

Implement the `get_cooordinate()` function that takes a `(treasure, coordinate)` pair from Azara's list and returns only the extracted map coordinate.

```julia-repl
julia> get_cooordinate( ("Scrimshaw Whale's Tooth", "2A") )
"2A"
```

## 2. Format coordinates

Implement the `convert_coordinate()` function that takes a coordinate in the format "2A" and returns a tuple in the format `('2', 'A')`.

```julia-repl
julia> convert_coordinate("2A")
('2', 'A')
```

## 3. Match coordinates

Implement the `compare_records()` function that takes a `(treasure, coordinate)` pair and a `(location, coordinate, quadrant)` record and compares coordinates from each.
Return **`true`** if the coordinates "match", and return **`false`** if they do not.
Re-format coordinates as needed for accurate comparison.

```julia-repl
julia> compare_records(("Brass Spyglass", "4B"), ("Seaside Cottages", ('1', 'C'), "blue"))
false

julia> compare_records(("Model Ship in Large Bottle", "8A"), ("Harbor Managers Office", ('8', 'A'), "purple"))
true
```

## 4. Combine matched records

Implement the `create_record()` function that takes a `(treasure, coordinate)` pair from Azara's list and a `(location, coordinate, quadrant)` record from Rui's list and returns `(coordinate, location, quadrant, treasure)` **if the coordinates match**.

If the coordinates _do not_ match, return an empty tuple.
Re-format coordinates as needed for accurate comparison.

```julia-repl
julia> create_record(("Brass Spyglass", "4B"), ("Abandoned Lighthouse", ('4', 'B'), "Blue"))
("4B", "Abandoned Lighthouse", "Blue", "Brass Spyglass")

julia> create_record(("Brass Spyglass", "4B"), ("Seaside Cottages", ('1', 'C'), "Blue"))
()
```
