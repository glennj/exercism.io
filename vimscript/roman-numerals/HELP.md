## Running the tests

Open your solution:

```bash
$ vim <exercise>.vim
```

Source the current file to make its global functions available to Vim:

```
:source %
```

Run the tests:

```
:Vader <exercise>.vader
```

Replace `<exercise>` with your exercise's name.

This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:
