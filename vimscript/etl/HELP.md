## Running the tests

Open your solution:

```bash
$ vim <exercise>.vim
```

Source the current file to make its global functions available to Vim:

```
:source %
```

Run the tests:

```
:Vader <exercise>.vader
```

Replace `<exercise>` with your exercise's name.

## Submitting your solution

This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
