# Generic feedback about individual exercises

Most often, feedback is language-specific. 
However, there is some common concepts that are applicable.

## leap

Can you combine the tests into one boolean expression (using [Logical operators][logical-ops])?
It often helps to say the leap year rules out loud using the words "and" and "or" and "not".

The key to this exercise is to combine the criteria into a single expression.
Use the [Logical Operators][logical-ops].

I find that it helps to speak the criteria out loud using the words "and" "or" and "not": something like

> It is a leap year if X or Y and Z.

## satellite

You've seen that preorder[0] represents the root of the tree.
For me the "a-ha" moment was realizing that, after finding the index of the root value in the inorder list, you can partition the inorder list into left and right sublists and also partition the preorder list into left and right sublists.

## word-count

In general, it's better to describe the "good" characters of words we want to keep (letters, numbers and apostrophe), and it's harder to list all the "bad" characters.
What about `|` or `[` or `]`?
What about characters that don't appear on the (US) keyboard like `€` or `é`?
