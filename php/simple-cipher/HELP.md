## Running the tests

## Running the tests

1. Go to the root of your PHP exercise directory, which is `<EXERCISM_WORKSPACE>/php`.
   To find the Exercism workspace run

       ➜ exercism debug | grep Workspace

1. Get [PHPUnit] if you don't have it already.

       ➜ wget -O phpunit https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-9.phar
       ➜ chmod +x phpunit
       ➜ ./phpunit --version

2. Execute the tests:

       ➜ ./phpunit file_to_test.php

   For example, to run the tests for the Hello World exercise, you would run:

       ➜ ./phpunit HelloWorldTest.php

[PHPUnit]: https://phpunit.de
