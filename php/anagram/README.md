# Anagram

Welcome to Anagram on Exercism's PHP Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

The skipped tests near the bottom of the anagram_test.php are **Stretch Goals**, they are optional. They require the usage of `mb_string` functions, which aren't installed by default with every version of PHP.
