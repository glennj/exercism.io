# Hello World

Welcome to Hello World on Exercism's Bash Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

The classical introductory exercise.
Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"][hello-world] is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Welcome to Bash!

Unlike many other languages here, bash is a bit of a special snowflake.
If you are on a Mac or other unix-y platform, you almost definitely
already have bash. In fact, anything you type into the terminal is
likely going through bash.

The downside to this is that there isn't much of a development
ecosystem around bash like there is for other languages, and there are
multiple versions of bash that can be frustratingly incompatible. Luckily
we shouldn't hit those differences for these basic examples, and if you
can get the tests to pass on your machine, we are doing great.
