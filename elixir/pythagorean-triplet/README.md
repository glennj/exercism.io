# Pythagorean Triplet

Welcome to Pythagorean Triplet on Exercism's Elixir Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Instructions

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which,

```text
a² + b² = c²
```

and such that,

```text
a < b < c
```

For example,

```text
3² + 4² = 5².
```

Given an input integer N, find all Pythagorean triplets for which `a + b + c = N`.

For example, with N = 1000, there is exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`: `{200, 375, 425}`.

## Slow tests

One or several of the tests of this exercise have been tagged as `:slow`, because they might take a long time to finish. For this reason, they will not be run on the platform by the automated test runner. If you are solving this exercise directly on the platform in the web editor, you might want to consider downloading this exercise to your machine instead. This will allow you to run all the tests and check the efficiency of your solution.
