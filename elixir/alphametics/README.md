# Alphametics

Welcome to Alphametics on Exercism's Elixir Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

[Alphametics][alphametics] is a puzzle where letters in words are replaced with numbers.

For example `SEND + MORE = MONEY`:

```text
  S E N D
  M O R E +
-----------
M O N E Y
```

Replacing these with valid numbers gives:

```text
  9 5 6 7
  1 0 8 5 +
-----------
1 0 6 5 2
```

This is correct because every letter is replaced by a different number and the words, translated into numbers, then make a valid sum.

Each letter must represent a different digit, and the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero.

Write a function to solve alphametics puzzles.

## Slow tests

One or several of the tests of this exercise have been tagged as `:slow`, because they might take a long time to finish. For this reason, they will not be run on the platform by the automated test runner. If you are solving this exercise directly on the platform in the web editor, you might want to consider downloading this exercise to your machine instead. This will allow you to run all the tests and check the efficiency of your solution.
