		"character_width: 100, The default is 80 but this results in very ugly code for long lines, use 100 prevent ungodly wrapping in most cases.",
		"tabs: true, the style guide mandates tabs over spaces (what can I say!)",
		"tabs_width: 4, not specified in the style guide but this is consistent with most other languages.",
		"newline_limit: 1, limits the number of empty lines between code blocks. Not specified in the style guide but there is no reason to use more than one.",
		"convert_do: true, convert do <stmt> to { <stmt> }. Not implemented in the current version, set to true because in future versions we would like to avoid do.",
		"brace_style: _1TBS, What is typically called K&R (opening brace on the line with the proc/if/switch)",
		"indent_case: false, specifies if case are indented from switch, false is consistent with Odin example code (https://github.com/odin-lang/examples)",
		"sort_imports: true, makes it easier to find imports.",
		"inline_single_stmt_case: false, doesn't aggregate a case and its online content on a single line, more explicit in my opinion",
		"spaces_aorund_colons: false, false results in `a: int` which is consistent with the style guide.",
		"space_single_line_blocks: true, put space inside brackets in statements like `if !okay { break }`, more readable."
