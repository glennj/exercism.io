# List Ops

Implement basic list operations.

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

## Setup

Go through the project setup instructions for Xcode using Swift:

Notably from the source directory:

`swift test` runs tests  
`swift package generate-xcodeproj` creates an Xcode project
