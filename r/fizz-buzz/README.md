# Fizz Buzz

Welcome to Fizz Buzz on Exercism's R Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Print numbers from 1 to n with the following rules:

1. When the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
2. When the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
3. When the number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, print "Fizz Buzz"
4. When the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the number

The output should be a vector of strings, such as, "1" "2" "Fizz" "4" "Buzz" ...
