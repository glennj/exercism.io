# Armstrong Numbers

An [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

- 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`
- 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`
- 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`
- 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`

Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

When you are finished writing and testing your solution, and want to submit it, you should right click on the `Exercise@ArmstrongNumbers` package and choose `Exercism | Submit exercise` in the context menu. You DON'T use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `ArmstrongNumbersTest`, will test the functionality of `ArmstrongNumbers`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).
