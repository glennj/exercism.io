# Allergies

Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the
information about all the allergies the person has (that they were
tested for).

The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

* eggs (1)
* peanuts (2)
* shellfish (4)
* strawberries (8)
* tomatoes (16)
* chocolate (32)
* pollen (64)
* cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able to say:

- Whether Tom is allergic to any one of those allergens listed above.
- All the allergens Tom is allergic to.

Note: a given score may include allergens **not** listed above (i.e.
allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.).  Your program should
ignore those components of the score.  For example, if the allergy
score is 257, your program should only report the eggs (1) allergy.


## Hint

Notice how each of the items is a power of 2, a property that you should be able to leverage.

Check out the 'bit manipulation' protocol of class Integer. 


## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `allergies` into the `Exercism | Fetch new exercise` top menu prompt (or right click on any `Exercise@<Name>` package in the Pharo System Browser).

When you are finished writing and testing your solution, and want to submit it, you should right click on the `Exercise@Allergies` package and choose `Exercism | Submit exercise` in the context menu. You DON'T use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `AllergiesTest`, will test the functionality of `Allergies`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).
