# Binary

Convert a binary number, represented as a string (e.g. '101010'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.

Implement binary to decimal conversion. Given a binary input
string, your program should produce a decimal output. The
program should handle invalid inputs.

## Note

- Implement the conversion yourself.
  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.

## About Binary (Base-2)

Decimal is a base-10 system.

A number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood
as a linear combination of powers of 10:

- The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1
- The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10
- ...
- The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.
- All these values are summed.

So: `23 => 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 => 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`

Binary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.

So: `101 => 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 => 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 => 4 + 1 => 5 base 10`.

## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `binary` into the `Exercism | Fetch new exercise` top menu prompt (or right click on any `Exercise@<Name>` package in the Pharo System Browser).

When you are finished writing and testing your solution, and want to submit it, you should right click on the `Exercise@Binary` package and choose `Exercism | Submit exercise` in the context menu. You DON'T use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `BinaryTest`, will test the functionality of `Binary`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).
