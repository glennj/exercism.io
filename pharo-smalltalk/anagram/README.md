# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.


## Hint

As with Isogram, it's worth browsing what data types are already available in the system. Also remember to take the tests step by step and try to build up a solution bit by bit. The debugger can also be your friend, and remember that it's possible to evaluate any expression or variable to better visualise and and understand how it works.


## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `anagram` into the `Exercism | Fetch new exercise` top menu prompt (or right click on any `Exercise@<Name>` package in the Pharo System Browser).

When you are finished writing and testing your solution, and want to submit it, you should right click on the `Exercise@Anagram` package and choose `Exercism | Submit exercise` in the context menu. You DON'T use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `AnagramTest`, will test the functionality of `Anagram`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).

## Language and Environment Help
