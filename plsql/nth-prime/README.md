# Nth Prime

Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime
numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for PL/SQL to get ready to code:

## Running the Tests

Execute the tests by calling the `run` method in the respective `ut_<exercise>#` package.
The necessary code should be contained at the end of the test package.
As an example, the test for the _hamming_ exercise would be run using
