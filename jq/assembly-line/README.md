# Assembly Line

Welcome to Assembly Line on Exercism's jq Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

## Numbers

From [the manual][man-types]

> jq supports the same set of datatypes as JSON - numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects (which in JSON-speak are hashes with only string keys), and "null".

Let's focus on **numbers**.

### Numbers and numeric operators

All numbers, whether integers or otherwise, are IEEE754 double precision floating point numbers.
This limits us to 53 bits of precision.

The usual operators are available to use with numbers:

- arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`
- standard [math functions][man-math]

  For one-input functions, pipe the value into the function

  ```sh
  $ jq -n '(1 | atan) * 4'
  3.141592653589793
  ```

  For two-input functions, the functions will ignore input and expect the
  inputs as parameters (recall parameters are separated by semicolons)

  ```sh
  $ jq -n 'pow(2; 10)'
  1024
  ```

  Semi-colon is the separator for function arguments, not comma.

### Other `jq` expressions

To solve the exercise, you will need to know about conditional expressions.

#### Conditional Expressions

`jq` uses an [`if-then-else` expression][if-then-else] for **conditional expressions**.
As an _expression_, it is placed in a pipeline.

Then syntax is: `if CONDITION then TRUE_EXPR else FALSE_EXPR end`.

The `else` clause is optional in jq v1.7, but it is required in jq v1.6.

```jq
42 | if . < 33 then "small" else "larger" end
# => "larger"
```

Additional conditions use `elif`

```jq
42 | if . < 33 then "small"
     elif . < 67 then "medium"
     else "large"
     end
# => "medium"
```

## Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to analyze the production of an assembly line in a car factory.
The assembly line's speed can range from `0` (off) to `10` (maximum).

At its slowest speed (`1`), `221` cars are produced each hour.
The production increases linearly with the speed.
So with the speed set to `4`, it should produce `4 * 221 = 884` cars per hour.
However, higher speeds increase the likelihood that faulty cars are produced, which then have to be discarded.
The following table shows how speed influences the success rate:

- `1` to `4`: 100% success rate.
- `5` to `8`: 90% success rate.
- `9`: 80% success rate.
- `10`: 77% success rate.

You have two tasks.

## 1. Calculate the production rate per hour

Calculate the assembly line's production rate per hour, taking into account its success rate.

## 2. Calculate the number of working items produced per minute

Calculate how many **completed, working cars** are produced per minute.
