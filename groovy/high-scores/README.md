# High Scores

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Groovy resources page](https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/resources).

Run the tests by executing the test script.

```sh
$ gradle test
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
