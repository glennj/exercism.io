# Gigasecond

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond
has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[Groovy resources page](https://exercism.io/tracks/groovy/resources).

Run the tests by executing the test script.

```sh
$ gradle test
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
