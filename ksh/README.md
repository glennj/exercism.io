# Korn Shell

As a companion to the Bash track, here are some experiments
with solving exercises using the Korn shell.

Interesting ksh features include:

* floating point arithmetic
* user-defined types that include compound variables and function: classes
  and objects!
* user-defined arithmetic functions, e.g. `m=$((min(a, b)))`
