# Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna

Welcome to Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna on Exercism's Python Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

[Python][python docs] is a [dynamic and strongly][dynamic typing in python] typed [object-oriented][object oriented programming] programming language.
It employs both [duck typing][duck typing] and [gradual typing][gradual typing], via [type hints][type hints].
Programming across paradigms is fully _supported_ -- but internally, [everything in Python is an object][everythings an object].

Python puts a strong emphasis on code readability and (_similar to Haskell_) uses [significant indentation][significant indentation] for function, method, and class definitions.
[The Zen of Python (PEP 20)][the zen of python] and [_What is Pythonic?_][what is pythonic] lay out additional philosophies.

Objects are [assigned][assignment statements] to [names][naming and binding] via the _assignment operator_, `=`.
[Variables][variables] are written in [`snake_case`][snake case], and _constants_ usually in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

A `name` (_variable or constant_) is not itself typed, and can be attached or re-attached to different objects over its lifetime.
For extended naming conventions and advice, see [PEP 8][pep8].

```python
>>> my_first_variable = 1
>>> my_first_variable = "Last one, I promise"
>>> print(my_first_variable)
...
"Last one, I promise"
```

Constants are typically defined on a [module][module] or _global_ level, and although they _can_ be changed, they are _intended_ to be named only once.

Their `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` is a message to other developers that the assignment should not be altered:

```python
# All caps signal that this is intended as a constant.
MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 16

# Re-assignment will be allowed by the compiler & interpreter,
# but this is VERY strongly discouraged.
# Please don't do: MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = "Some other value"
```

The keyword `def` begins a [function definition][function definition].
It must be followed by the function name and a parenthesized list of zero or more formal [parameters][parameters].
 Parameters can be of several different varieties, and can even [vary][more on functions] in length.
The `def` line is terminated with a colon.

Statements for the _body_ of the function begin on the line following `def` and must be _indented in a block_.
There is no strict indentation amount (_either space **OR** [tab] characters are acceptable_), but [indentation][indentation] must be _consistent for all indented statements_.

Functions explicitly return a value or object via the [`return`][return] keyword.

```python
# Function definition on first line.
def add_two_numbers(number_one, number_two):
  return number_one + number_two  # Returns the sum of the numbers, and is indented by 2 spaces.

>>> add_two_numbers(3, 4)
7
```

Functions that do not have an explicit `return` expression will return [`None`][none].

```python
# This function will return None.
def add_two_numbers(number_one, number_two):
  result = number_one + number_two

>>> print(add_two_numbers(5, 7))
None
```

Inconsistent indentation will raise an error:

```python
# The return statement line does not match the first line indent.
>>> def add_three_numbers_misformatted(number_one, number_two, number_three):
...     result = number_one + number_two + number_three   # Indented by 4 spaces.
...    return result     #this was only indented by 3 spaces
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    return result
                ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
```

Functions are [_called_][calls] using their name followed by `()`.
The number of arguments passed in the parentheses must match the number of parameters in the original function definition unless [default arguments][default arguments] have been used:

```python
>>> def number_to_the_power_of(number_one, number_two):
        """Raise a number to an arbitrary power.
        
        :param number_one: int the base number.
        :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.
        :return: int - number raised to power of second number
        
        Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.
        """
        
        return number_one ** number_two
...

>>> number_to_the_power_of(3,3)
27
```

A mis-match between parameters and arguments will raise an error:

```python
>>> number_to_the_power_of(4,)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: number_to_the_power_of() missing 1 required positional argument: 'number_two'

```

Adding a [default value][default arguments] for a parameter can defend against such errors:

```python
>>> def number_to_the_power_of_default(number_one, number_two=2):
        """Raise a number to an arbitrary power.
        
        :param number_one: int the base number.
        :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.
        :return: int - number raised to power of second number
        
        Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.
        """

        return number_one ** number_two

...
>>> number_to_the_power_of_default(4)
16
```

Methods bound to class names are invoked via dot notation (.), as are functions, constants, or global names imported as part of a module.:

```python

import string

# This is a constant provided by the *string* module.
>>> print(string.ascii_lowercase)
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

# This is a method call of the str *class*.
>>> start_text = "my silly sentence for examples."
>>> str.upper(start_text)
"MY SILLY SENTENCE FOR EXAMPLES."

# This is a method call of an *instance* of the str *class*.
>>> start_text.upper()
"MY SILLY SENTENCE FOR EXAMPLES."
```

[Comments][comments] in Python start with a `#` that is not part of a string, and end at line termination.
Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not support multi-line comment marks.
Each line of a comment block must start with the `#` character.

Comments are ignored by the interpreter:

```python
# This is a single line comment.

x = "foo"  # This is an in-line comment.

# This is a multi-line
# comment block over multiple lines --
# these should be used sparingly.
```

The first statement of a function body can optionally be a [_docstring_][docstring], which concisely summarizes the function or object's purpose.
Docstrings are read by automated documentation tools and are returned by calling `.__doc__` on the function, method, or class name.
They can also function as [lightweight unit tests][doctests], which will be covered in a later exercise.
They are recommended for programs of any size where documentation is needed, and their conventions are laid out in [PEP257][PEP257]:

```python
# An example on a user-defined function.
>>> def number_to_the_power_of(number_one, number_two):
        """Raise a number to an arbitrary power.
        
        :param number_one: int the base number.
        :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.
        :return: int - number raised to power of second number
        
        Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.
        """

        return number_one ** number_two
...

>>> print(number_to_the_power_of.__doc__)
Raise a number to an arbitrary power.

    :param number_one: int the base number.
    :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.
    :return: int - number raised to power of second number

    Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.

# __doc__() for the built-in type: str.
>>> print(str.__doc__)
str(object='') -> str
str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str

Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
or repr(object).
encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
errors defaults to 'strict'.

## Instructions

You're going to write some code to help you cook a gorgeous lasagna from your favorite cookbook.

You have five tasks, all related to cooking your recipe.

## 1. Define expected bake time in minutes

Define an `EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME` constant that returns how many minutes the lasagna should bake in the oven.
According to your cookbook, the Lasagna should be in the oven for 40 minutes:

```python
>>> import lasagna
>>> lasagna.EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME
40
```

## 2. Calculate remaining bake time in minutes

Implement the `bake_time_remaining()` function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as an argument and returns how many minutes the lasagna still needs to bake based on the `EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME`.

```python
>>> from lasagna import bake_time_remaining
>>> bake_time_remaining(30)
10
```

## 3. Calculate preparation time in minutes

Implement the `preparation_time_in_minutes()` function that takes the number of layers you want to add to the lasagna as an argument and returns how many minutes you would spend making them.
Assume each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare.

```python
>>> from lasagna import preparation_time_in_minutes
>>> preparation_time_in_minutes(2)
4
```

## 4. Calculate total elapsed cooking time (prep + bake) in minutes

Implement the `elapsed_time_in_minutes()` function that has two parameters: `number_of_layers` (_the number of layers added to the lasagna_) and `elapsed_bake_time` (_the number of minutes the lasagna has been baking in the oven_).
This function should return the total number of minutes you've been cooking, or the sum of your preparation time and the time the lasagna has already spent baking in the oven.

```python
>>> from lasagna import elapsed_time_in_minutes
>>> elapsed_time_in_minutes(3, 20)
26
```

## 5. Update the recipe with notes

Go back through the recipe, adding notes and documentation.

```python
def elapsed_time_in_minutes(number_of_layers, elapsed_bake_time):
    """
    Return elapsed cooking time.

    This function takes two numbers representing the number of layers & the time already spent 
    baking and calculates the total elapsed minutes spent cooking the lasagna.
    """
```
