# Hints

- Make sure you have a good understanding of how to create and update lists.
- The Python [documentation on `lists`][python lists] can be really helpful.
- The Python [tutorial section on `lists`][more on lists] is also a good resource.

## 1. Add Me to the queue

- An `if-else` statement can help you find which ticket type you are dealing with.
- You can then `append()` the person to the queue based on the ticket type.

## 2. Where are my friends

- You need to find the `index()` of the friend name from the queue.

## 3. Can I please join them?

- Since you know the `index()`, you can `insert()` the friend into the queue at that point.

## 4. Mean person in the queue

- You know the mean persons name, so you can `remove()` them from the queue.

## 5. Namefellows

-  `count()`-ing the occurrences of the `name` in the queue could be a good strategy here.

## 6. Remove the last person

- Although you could `remove()` the person by name, `pop()`-ing them out might be quicker.

## 7. Sort the Queue List

- Don't forget that You need to avoid mutating the queue and losing its original order.
- Once you have a `copy()`, `sort()`-ing should be straightforward.
- We're looking for an _ascending_ sort, or _alphabetical from a-z_.
