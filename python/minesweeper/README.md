# Minesweeper

Add the numbers to a minesweeper board.

Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using
numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent
(horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of
mines adjacent to a square and transforms boards like this (where `*`
indicates a mine):

    +-----+
    | * * |
    |  *  |
    |  *  |
    |     |
    +-----+

into this:

    +-----+
    |1*3*1|
    |13*31|
    | 2*2 |
    | 111 |
    +-----+

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):

- Python 2.7: `py.test minesweeper_test.py`
- Python 3.4+: `pytest minesweeper_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):
`python -m pytest minesweeper_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/minesweeper` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see [Running the Tests](http://exercism.io/tracks/python/tests).

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
