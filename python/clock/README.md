# Clock

Welcome to Clock on Exercism's Python Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

The tests for this exercise expect your clock will be implemented via a Clock `class` in Python.
If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.
## Representing your class

When working with and debugging objects, it's important to have a string representation of that object.
For example, if you were to create a new `datetime.datetime` object in the Python [REPL][REPL] environment, you could see its string representation:

```python
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> new_date = datetime(2022, 5, 4)
>>> new_date
datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4, 0, 0)

Your Clock `class` will create a custom `object` that handles times without dates.
One important aspect of this `class` will be how it is represented as a _string_.
Other programmers who use or call Clock `objects` created from the Clock `class` will refer to this string representation for debugging and other activities.  
However, the default string representation on a `class` is usually not very helpful.

```python
>>> Clock(12, 34)
<Clock object st 0x102807b20 >
```

To create a more helpful representation, you can define a `__repr__` method on the `class` that returns a string.

Ideally, the `__repr__` method returns valid Python code that can be used to recreate the object -- as laid out in the [specification for a `__repr__` method][repr-docs].
Returning valid Python code allows you to copy-paste the `str` directly into code or the REPL.

For example, a `Clock` that represents 11:30 AM could look like this: `Clock(11, 30)`.

Defining a `__repr__` method is good practice for all classes.
Some things to consider:

- The information returned from this method should be beneficial when debugging issues.
- _Ideally_, the method returns a string that is valid Python code -- although that might not always be possible.
- If valid Python code is not practical, returning a description between angle brackets: `< ...a practical description... >` is the convention.


### String conversion

In addition to the `__repr__` method, there might also be a need for an alternative "human-readable" string representation of the `class`.
This might be used to format the object for program output or documentation.
Looking at `datetime.datetime` again:

```python
>>> str(datetime.datetime(2022, 5, 4))
'2022-05-04 00:00:00'
```

When a `datetime` object is asked to convert itself to a string representation, it returns a `str` formatted according to the [ISO 8601 standard][ISO 8601], which can be parsed by most datetime libraries into a human-readable date and time.

In this exercise, you will get a chance to write a `__str__` method, as well as a `__repr__`.

```python
>>> str(Clock(11, 30))
'11:30'
```

To support this string conversion, you will need to create a `__str__` method on your class that returns a more "human readable" string showing the Clock time.

If you don't create a `__str__` method and you call `str()` on your class, python will try calling `__repr__` on your class as a fallback. So if you only implement one of the two, it would be better to create a `__repr__` method.
