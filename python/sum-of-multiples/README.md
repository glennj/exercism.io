# Sum of Multiples

Welcome to Sum of Multiples on Exercism's Python Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

You can make the following assumptions about the inputs to the
`sum_of_multiples` function:
* All input numbers are non-negative `int`s, i.e. natural numbers
including zero.
* A list of factors must be given, and its elements are unique
and sorted in ascending order.
