# Simple Linked List

Welcome to Simple Linked List on Exercism's Python Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Write a simple linked list implementation that uses Elements and a List.

The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science,
often used in the implementation of other data structures. They're
pervasive in functional programming languages, such as Clojure, Erlang,
or Haskell, but far less common in imperative languages such as Ruby or
Python.

The simplest kind of linked list is a singly linked list. Each element in the
list contains data and a "next" field pointing to the next element in the list
of elements.

This variant of linked lists is often used to represent sequences or
push-down stacks (also called a LIFO stack; Last In, First Out).

As a first take, lets create a singly linked list to contain the range (1..10),
and provide functions to reverse a linked list and convert to and from arrays.

When implementing this in a language with built-in linked lists,
implement your own abstract data type.

## Customizing and Raising Exceptions

Sometimes it is necessary to both [customize](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions) and [`raise`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions) exceptions in your code. When you do this, you should always include a **meaningful error message** to indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging.

Custom exceptions can be created through new exception classes (see [`classes`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-classes) for more detail.) that are typically subclasses of [`Exception`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception).

For situations where you know the error source will be a derivative of a certain exception _type_, you can choose to inherit from one of the [`built in error types`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#base-classes) under the _Exception_ class. When raising the error, you should still include a meaningful message.

This particular exercise requires that you create a _custom exception_ to be [raised](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement)/"thrown" when your linked list is **empty**. The tests will only pass if you customize appropriate exceptions, `raise` those exceptions, and include appropriate error messages.

To customize a generic _exception_, create a `class` that inherits from `Exception`. When raising the custom exception with a message, write the message as an argument to the `exception` type:

```python
# subclassing Exception to create EmptyListException
class EmptyListException(Exception):
    """Exception raised when the linked list is empty.

    message: explanation of the error.

    """
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message
        
# raising an EmptyListException
raise EmptyListException("The list is empty.")
```

## Additional Hints

To support `list()`, see [implementing an iterator for a class.](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators)

Note that Python2's `next()` was replaced by `__next__()` in Python3. If dual compatibility is needed, `next()` can be implemented as:

```Python
def next(self):
    return self.__next__()
```
