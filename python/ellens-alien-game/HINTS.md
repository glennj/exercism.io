# Hints

## 1. Create the Alien Class

- Remember that object methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.
- Remember the double underscores on _both_ sides of `__init__`.
- Instance variables are unique to the class instance (object) that possesses them.
- Class variables are the same across all instances of a class.

## 2. The `hit` Method

- Remember that object methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.

## 3. The `is_alive` Method

- Remember that object methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.
- 0 is not the only 'dead' condition.

## 4. The `teleport` Method

- Remember that object methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.

## 5. The `collision_detection` Method

- Remember that object methods are always passed `self` as the first parameter.
- This method seems like an excellent place to use some kind of placeholder.

## 6. Alien Counter

- Class variables are the same across all instances of a class.

## 7. Object Creation

- A tuple would be a _single_ parameter.
- The Alien constructor takes 2 parameters.
- Unpacking what is _inside_ the tuple might be closer to what you need.
