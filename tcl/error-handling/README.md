# Error Handling

Implement various kinds of error handling and resource management.

An important point of programming is how to handle errors and close
resources even if errors occur.

This exercise requires you to handle various errors. Because error handling
is rather programming language specific you'll have to refer to the tests
for your track to see what's exactly required.

## Resources

The Tcl Wiki entry on [Errors management](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Errors+management)
is useful for this exercise.



## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh error-handling.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh error-handling.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
