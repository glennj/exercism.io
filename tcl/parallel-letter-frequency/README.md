# Parallel Letter Frequency

Welcome to Parallel Letter Frequency on Exercism's Tcl Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Count the frequency of letters in texts using parallel computation.

Parallelism is about doing things in parallel that can also be done
sequentially. A common example is counting the frequency of letters.
Create a function that returns the total frequency of each letter in a
list of texts and that employs parallelism.

You'll implement parallelism with threads: subdivide the input into chunks
that code running in a thread can examine asynchronously.

    * Note, this chapter states "Most binary distributions of Tcl are not thread-enabled". This is no longer the case: Tcl distributions are now built with thread support (ref [TIP 364](https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/364.md))
* [Thread Package Commands](https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/ThreadCmd/contents.htm) from the Tcl documentation.
