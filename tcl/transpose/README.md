# Transpose

Given an input text output it transposed.

Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:

```text
ABC
DEF
```

is given by:

```text
AD
BE
CF
```

Rows become columns and columns become rows. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose>.

If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:

- Pad to the left with spaces.
- Don't pad to the right.

Therefore, transposing this matrix:

```text
ABC
DE
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
C
```

And transposing:

```text
AB
DEF
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
 F
```

In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.
That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s),
the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh transpose.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh transpose.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
