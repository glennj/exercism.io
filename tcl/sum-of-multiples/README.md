# Sum Of Multiples

Given a number, find the sum of all the unique multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh sum-of-multiples.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh sum-of-multiples.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
