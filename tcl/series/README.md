# Series

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in
that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh series.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh series.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
