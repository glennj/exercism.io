# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh flatten-array.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh flatten-array.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
