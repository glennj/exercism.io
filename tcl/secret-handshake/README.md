# Secret Handshake

> There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand
> binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to
binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```text
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 3, the function would return the array
["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.

Given the input 19, the function would return the array
["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary.
Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary)
has caused the array to be reversed.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh secret-handshake.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh secret-handshake.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
