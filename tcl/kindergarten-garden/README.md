# Kindergarten Garden

Given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is
responsible for.

The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants. The teacher
thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in
actual dirt, and grow actual plants.

They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.

To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills, and
planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the available
types of seeds.

```text
[window][window][window]
........................ # each dot represents a cup
........................
```

There are 12 children in the class:

- Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,
- Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,
- Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.

Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row. Their teacher assigns cups to
the children alphabetically by their names.

The following diagram represents Alice's plants:

```text
[window][window][window]
VR......................
RG......................
```

In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  In the
second row she has a radish and some grass.

Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with
the row nearest the windows. From this, it should be able to determine
which plants belong to each student.

For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:

```text
[window][window][window]
VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV
VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV
```

Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:

- Violets, radishes, violets, radishes

While asking for Bob's plants would yield:

- Clover, grass, clover, clover

To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh kindergarten-garden.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh kindergarten-garden.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
