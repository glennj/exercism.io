# Accumulate

Implement the `accumulate` operation, which, given a collection and an
operation to perform on each element of the collection, returns a new
collection containing the result of applying that operation to each element of
the input collection.

Given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the operation:

- square a number (`x => x * x`)

Your code should be able to produce the collection of squares:

- 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

Check out the test suite to see the expected function signature.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that collect/map/fmap/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!
Solve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.


## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh accumulate.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh accumulate.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/tcl](https://github.com/exercism/tcl) repository on GitHub is
the home for all of the Tcl exercises on Exercism.

one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!
