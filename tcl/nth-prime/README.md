# Nth Prime

Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime
numbers, pretend they don't exist and implement them yourself.

## Running the tests
To run the test suite, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
tclsh nth-prime.test            # Will stop testing after the first failure.
RUN_ALL=1 tclsh nth-prime.test  # Will run all tests and report all failures.
```
