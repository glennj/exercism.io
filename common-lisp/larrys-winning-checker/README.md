# Larry's Winning Checker

Welcome to Larry's Winning Checker on Exercism's Common Lisp Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

## Arrays

In Common Lisp like other languages an array is a set of elements which are accessed via integral indexes.
The types of the elements can be heterogeneous.
The array can be multi-dimensional (not simply 1-dimensional).

### Creating

`make-array` allows one to create arrays.
It has many options but its simpler forms allow one to create N-dimensional arrays with all elements initialized to a single value or the array initialized to the values in another sequence (such as a list). 
Its first argument is a list of the size of each dimension.

```lisp
(make-array '(4) :initial-element 3)    ; => #(3 3 3 3)
(make-array '(2 2) :initial-element 'x) ; => #2A((X X) (X X))
```

(Notice how the N-dimensional arrays are printed with the number of dimensions.)

Arrays can also be created by using the same format they are printed in: 

```lisp
#(x y z)         ; => #(X Y Z)
#2A((1 2) (3 4)) ; => #2A((1 2) (3 4))
```

### Accessing Elements

To access elements of a vector use `aref`, the indexes are zero-based. 
The number of indexes provided must match the rank of the array.

```lisp
(aref #2A((1 2 3) (3 4 5)) 
       1 0)           ; => 3
(aref #3A(((a b) (c d)) 
           ((e f) (g h)) 
           ((t u) (v w))) 
       2 0 1)         ; => U
(aref #2A((1) (2)) 0) ; => ERROR (because not enough indexes provided)
```

## Instructions

Larry is a Lisp Alien that likes to write code to play games. 
Today they want to write a few functions to help them with a game which is a lot like tic-tac-toe.

Like tic-tac-toe this game is played on a board which is a 3x3 grid.

## 1. Starting from scratch

First Larry needs a function to make a blank board `make-empty-board`
All the cells of the board should be `NIL`.

```lisp
(make-empty-board) ; => #2A((NIL NIL NIL) (NIL NIL NIL) (NIL NIL NIL))
```

## 2. Starting from an existing board

Next Larry needs a function to make a board from a list of rows. 
For example:

```lisp
(make-board-from-list '((A B C) (D E F) (G H I))) ; => #2A((A B C) (D E F) (G H I))
```

## 3. Winning condition

If there is a case where there are 3 of the same symbol in a row then that player has won.
Larry will need a function, `all-the-same-p`, which given an array of 3 items will evaluate to `T` if all the items are the same symbol.
(`eq` can be used to determine if two symbols are the same.)

```lisp
(all-the-same-p #(A A A)) ; => T
(all-the-same-p #(A B C)) ; => NIL
```

## 4. In a row

Now Larry needs a way to get the elements of a row.
The function `row` will take a board and a row number and should return an array of the elements in that row.

```lisp
(row #2A((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)) 1) ; => #(4 5 6)
```

## 5. In a column

Finally Larry needs a way to get the elements of a column.
The function `column` will take a board and a column number and should return an array of the elements in that column.

```lisp
(column #2A((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)) 1) ; => #(2 5 8)
```
