# Echo Service

Welcome to Echo Service on Exercism's Ballerina Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Creating a service in Ballerina is easy. Now you can add a query parameter and a relative path.

## Objectives

- Modify the provided code.
- It should have an echo endpoint that returns the value of a query parameter `sound`. The service should respond to a GET HTTP request at the path `/echo?sound=hello`.
- It should have another endpoint to define the word "echo" that returns the string `"A sound or series of sounds caused by the reflection of sound waves from a surface back to the listener."`. The service should respond to a GET HTTP request at the path `/echo/definition`.
