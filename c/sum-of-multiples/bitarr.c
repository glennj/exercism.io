             for a record of changes).

  IMPORTANT NOTE: A version of this code appeared in 
                  Dr. Dobb's Journal issue #233 (August 1995)
                  Volume 20 Issue 8
                  in an article entitled `Implementing Bit Vectors in C'
                  by James Blustein
                  Pages 42, 44, 46 (article) and pages 96, 98-100 (code)
                  The code is (c) copyright 1995 by Miller Freeman, Inc.

  DESCRIPTION: Functions to create and manipulate arrays of bits, i.e. `bit
     vectors'.  Functions to: dynamically create arrays, access (read and
     write) elements; convert from numbers to bit vectors and bit vectors
     to strings.  Additional mathematical functions (union, intersection,
     complement, number of set bits) are provided that are more efficient
     than naive implementations.
               The module was designed to be robust enough to work with
     machines of different word sizes.  Only a couple of minor changes are
     required to change it from using unsigned char for `bits' to another
     integer type.  See ba_init() and the definition of BITS_SZ for details.
               Only minimal optimization has been attempted.

               It is the caller's responsibility to know the size of the
     bit vector.  One way to keep track of the size is to wrap the bit
     vector in a data structure like the one below.  Note that the // is 
     used to mark a single line comment.  Only the first two items are 
     necessary -- the others are included for illustration only.

      typedef struct {
                elem_t  size;     // how many items in selected
                bits *  selected; // bit vector recording which 
                                  // elements are selected 
                elem_t  max;      // maximum possible size
                char ** name;     // array of names of items 
                elem_t  max_len;  // maximum possible length of a name 
                char *  title;    // what data is represented 
                                  // by this struct? 
            } chose_t;

  TYPEDEF NAMES
            "types.h" must include definitions of the following 4 types
                      bool   = a Boolean type (0 == FALSE, !0 == TRUE)
                      string = char *
                      elem_t = a number (used as a count, i.e. never < 0, 
                               throughout).
                      bit    = an unsigned integer
                               + If this is not unsigned char then the #define
                                 of BITS_SZ as CHAR_BIT should be changed.
                               + If this is not internally represented by 8 
                                 bits then the lookup table in ba_count() must
                                 be replaced.
                               + SEE NOTE dated 13 August 1996 in changes.html
                                 for a better solution.
