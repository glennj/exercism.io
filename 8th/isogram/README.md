# Isogram

Welcome to Isogram on Exercism's 8th Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Running and testing your solutions
 
### From the command line
 
Simply type `8th test.8th`. It is assumed that the 8th binary is declared in the PATH environment variable.
 
### From a REPL
 
Start 8th loading test-words.8th and your solution file:
`8th -f test-words.8th -f isogram-tests.8th`
This will start a CLI session where you can run tests interactively by copying and pasting them in from isogram-tests.8th or by entering your own. 
 
### Editing the isogram-tests.8th file
 
This is encouraged at the beginning of your journey. Insert a back-slash space before all but the first one or two tests. Write your code to solve the first test or two. Then progressively enable more tests until you can pass all of them.
