# Triangle

Welcome to Triangle on Exercism's 8th Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.

An _isosceles_ triangle has at least two sides the same length.
(It is sometimes specified as having exactly two sides the same length, but for the purposes of this exercise we'll say at least two.)

A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Note

For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides have to be of length > 0, and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

In equations:

Let `a`, `b`, and `c` be sides of the triangle.
Then all three of the following expressions must be true:

```text
a + b ≥ c
b + c ≥ a
a + c ≥ b
```

## Running and testing your solutions
 
### From the command line
 
Simply type `8th test.8th`. It is assumed that the 8th binary is declared in the PATH environment variable.
 
### From a REPL
 
Start 8th loading test-words.8th: `8th -f test-words.8th`.
This will start a CLI session where, once you’ve written some code in your solution file, you can load it with `"triangle.8th" f:include`
and you can run the tests with `"triangle-tests.8th" f:include` or you can copy and paste a single test from that file or enter your own. 
 
### Editing the triangle-tests.8th file
 
This is encouraged at the beginning of your journey. Insert a back-slash space before all but the first one or two tests. Write your code to solve the first test or two. Then progressively enable more tests until you can pass all of them.
