# Raindrops

Welcome to Raindrops on Exercism's 8th Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors.
A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder.
The simplest way to test if one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation][modulo].

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".

## Running and testing your solutions
 
### From the command line
 
Simply type `8th test.8th`. It is assumed that the 8th binary is declared in the PATH environment variable.
 
### From a REPL
 
Start 8th loading test-words.8th: `8th -f test-words.8th`.
This will start a CLI session where, once youâ€™ve written some code in your solution file, you can load it with `"raindrops.8th" f:include`
and you can run the tests with `"raindrops-tests.8th" f:include` or you can copy and paste a single test from that file or enter your own. 
 
### Editing the raindrops-tests.8th file
 
This is encouraged at the beginning of your journey. Insert a back-slash space before all but the first one or two tests. Write your code to solve the first test or two. Then progressively enable more tests until you can pass all of them.
