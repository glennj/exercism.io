# Reverse string

Welcome to Reverse string on Exercism's 8th Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Reverse a string

For example:
input: "cool"
output: "looc"

## Running and testing your solutions
 
### From the command line
 
Simply type `8th test.8th`. It is assumed that the 8th binary is declared in the PATH environment variable.
 
### From a REPL

Start 8th loading test-words.8th: `8th -f test-words.8th`.
This will start a CLI session where, once youâ€™ve written some code in your solution file, you can load it with `"reverse-string.8th" f:include`
and you can run the tests with `"reverse-string-tests.8th" f:include` or you can copy and paste a single test from that file or enter your own. 
 
### Editing the reverse-string-tests.8th file
 
This is encouraged at the beginning of your journey. Insert a back-slash space before all but the first one or two tests. Write your code to solve the first test or two. Then progressively enable more tests until you can pass all of them.
