# Thoughts while doing Arturo track

## Test Runner

All my submissions are failing due to the missing Conversions library.
Check the version of Arturo it's built with.

## config.json

All the exercises are easy? Really? It's an unsorted mess.

## Exercises

### Gigasecond

Disappointed at how easy it is:

```arturo
after.seconds:1000000000 date
```

There should be at least a parsing/formatting aspect here.
