# Gigasecond

Welcome to Gigasecond on Exercism's AWK Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

## Time functions

This exercise requires using GNU awk's [Time Functions][time-func].

For the datetime parsing and formatting functions, be sure to set the UTC flag.
