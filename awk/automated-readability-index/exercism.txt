Exercism is an online, open-source, free coding platform
that offers code practice and mentorship on 62 different
programming languages.

Software developer Katrina Owen created Exercism while
she was teaching programming at Jumpstart Labs.
The platform was developed as an internal tool to solve
the problem of her own students not receiving feedback
on the coding problems they were practicing. Katrina put
the site publicly online and found that people were sharing
it with their friends, practicing together and giving
each other feedback. Within 12 months, the site had
organically grown to see over 6,000 users had submitted
code or feedback, and hundreds of volunteers contribute
to the languages or tooling on the platform.
